# Laghuis

**Laughter House**

A single sound can change everything.

Laghuis is an interactive space that asks its participants to do the seemingly
impossible and pause for breath in the intoxicating chaos of the Burn world. A
modern cave for the desert dwellers, Laghuis beckons participants from the
Binnekring to a quieter place outside of the hubbub and encourages them to play
with light and sound. Featuring illuminated hyena and jackal heads surmounting
the structure to guide you in, an echo feedback system that gives the aural
illusion of a cave-like space and cut outs in the walls of elegantly simple
designs that pay homage to the memory of early humans.
